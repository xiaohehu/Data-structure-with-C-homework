#Homework 3

The program QuadraticWithClass.cpp which is attached to this file is a sample program from Homework 1 which uses a class named Quadratic.  However, it does not use a Container class.  So, the main() procedure knows far more about the contents of the class and its object than it needs to know.  For example, we should be able to make the calls bOver2A and radicalOver2A from a Container class so that the main() will never see them. Also, it may be possible to use the call to Discrim only in the Container class. After the overload constructor has been called to create and populate the object, ideally only one method call in the main() should be needed in order to produce the the result for the user.  Please revise this program so that it uses a Container class in order to move as many calls as possible from the main() to the methods of your container while retaining the display of the output in the main().
