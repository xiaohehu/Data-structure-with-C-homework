Problem 1 

A simple calculator adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides double-precision numbers.   The calculator must test for valid numeric inputs, as well as attempts to divide by zero.  An attempt to divide by 0 will cause the program to terminate with an error message.  After the <Enter> key is struck following each operand after the first, the result of that calculation is shown.  Also, if the user next enters one of the four arithmetic operators +, -, * or / after the <Enter> key is struck, the calculator allows the input of that one of the four arithmetic operators and a third number, so that expressions are allowed such as a+b<Enter>, a+b+c<Enter>, a+b-c<Enter>, a\*c \<Enter\>, a/d\<Enter\>, a\*b \<Enter\>,  a\*b\*c\<Enter\>,  a/c\*d\<Enter\>, a+b/c*d<Enter>  etc.  Also inputs of the form a<Enter>+<Enter>b<Enter> are allowed. These combinations of numbers and operators may be continued as far as the user continues to enter them.  Also, note that parentheses are not allowed in the actual expressions to be entered.  The user should use your keyboard EOF to terminate the program, which clears the memory.  Please write a C++ program which contains a C++ class to handle the necessary arithmetic.  Also, please include in your program a C++ container class which manages the actions of the four arithmetic operators.
