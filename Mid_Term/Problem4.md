Midterm Problem 4

When doing memory management on a system, one approach is to initially assign 4k (4096) bytes of heap memory to a client process and to return the reference to that heap memory to the process.  When the process has used up the 4k bytes, we assign it 8k more bytes, and when that is used up, we assign 16k more bytes.  If the process requires more heap memory, we assign it cumulatively in increasing multiples of 2, i.e. 32k, 64k, 128k etc.  Each time we return the reference to the start of the new heap memory until the process has exhausted its available amount of heap.  Also, each time we track the references to the first byte of new heap assigned. The maximum amount of heap which is available to a process is equal to the maximum integer (INTMAX) which is available on the system.  When the heap available to the process is exhausted, we return a value of NULL to the process.  Please write a function named getHeapMemory() which tracks the amount of heap assigned to a process and which returns to its caller the reference to the new heap or the value of NULL when the userâ€™s heap is exhausted.
